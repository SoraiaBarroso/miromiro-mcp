description: Rebuild a section of a real website as component code. Use when the user asks to clone, copy, port, recreate, or rebuild part of a live site (a hero, pricing table, footer, navbar), or says "make it look like <url>" and wants actual markup rather than just colors. Also when they build in WordPress/Elementor or Shopify and want a section they can import into their site.

# Rebuild a section from a live site

Use the `extract_code` tool. It resolves the page's real CSS cascade and returns a
self-contained component with the site's true colors, fonts, spacing and copy, so you
adapt real values instead of guessing from a screenshot.

## Picking the section

When the user names a part of the page ("their pricing table", "the footer", "the nav"),
pass it as `section`: one of `hero`, `header`, `footer`, `pricing`, `features`,
`testimonials`, `faq`, `cta`. MiroMiro finds that block on the page itself, so you never
have to see the markup. Never invent a CSS selector like `.pricing` - a selector that
matches nothing falls back to the hero with a `note`, and the guess still costs a call.

With no `section`, `extract_code` auto-detects the hero. Every response also returns a
`sections` array listing the other extractable sections with a human-readable label and a
ready-to-use selector: when the part the user wants is not one of the named sections, find
it there and call again with that `selector`.

## Choosing the framework

Match the user's project, don't default blindly:

- `tailwind` (default) — Tailwind utility classes in the markup
- `jsx` — a React component; pass `name` to set the component name. Repeated structures
  (tiers, cards, list items) come back as one template plus a `const items = […]` array
  rendered with `.map()` — use the data array, don't re-expand it.
- `vue` — a single-file component with `<script setup>`; `name` applies here too, and
  repeated structures collapse into a `v-for` the same way
- `html` — plain HTML plus a companion `css` string
- `elementor` — an importable Elementor template for WordPress. `code` is the whole
  template JSON: have the user save it as a `.json` file and import it under Templates >
  Saved Templates > Import.
- `shopify` — a Shopify theme section. `code` is the whole Liquid file: save it as
  `sections/<name>.liquid` in the theme code editor, then add the section from the theme
  editor. Not in a Custom Liquid block - that block is capped at 50 KB and cannot hold the
  section's schema.

Elementor and Shopify output arrives as one styled HTML block, edited as code rather than
as native widgets, with responsive and hover styles included and the CSS scoped so it
cannot clash with the theme. Hand the file over complete and unmodified; `css` is null
because the file already carries its styles.

For tailwind, jsx and vue, the `css` field may also carry the section's `@keyframes` — add
those to the project's global stylesheet or the animations silently do nothing.

If the repo you are working in already uses one of these, use it without asking. A user
who mentions WordPress, Elementor, Shopify or a theme wants the importable file, not a
component.

## Light or dark

Pass `theme: "dark"` when the user is looking at the site in dark mode or asks for the
dark version; the response's `theme` field reports which one you actually got, so tell the
user when it differs from what they see. Sites that switch themes purely in JavaScript
cannot be selected this way.

## When a result comes back thin

The API reads static HTML and CSS by default, and the response tells you how it went:
`summary.styledCoverage` (0-100) is the percentage of elements the CSS cascade resolved
styles for, and when the page is client-rendered or styles itself at runtime the response
includes a `hint` field saying what to do. When you see the `hint` (or coverage is low),
call again with `render: true` — it runs the page in a real browser so its JavaScript
executes first. It is slower and costs 5 extra credits, so treat it as the retry, not
the default. With `render: true` you can also pass `screenshot: true` (or `"full"`) to get
a URL of the rendered page, useful to show the user what was extracted.

## After you get the code

Adapt rather than paste verbatim:

- Keep the extracted colors, fonts, spacing and copy — that fidelity is the whole point.
- Rewrite the structure to fit the target project's conventions and component patterns.
- Swap any absolute asset URLs for local assets, or keep them if the user wants a
  reference build.
- The response also carries the design tokens that section actually uses. Wire those into
  the project's theme instead of hardcoding hex values, when the project has a theme.

Remind the user to check a site's terms before reusing its assets or copy commercially.
Extracting for reference and learning is fine; republishing someone's content is theirs to
license, not yours to assume.
